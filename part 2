		<p>Hello, Assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh, namo budhaya, shalom, om swastiastu and greetings to all of us. Introducing my name is <span>Apriansyah</span>, I am now 21 years old, I was born on August 5, 2000. My height is 165 cm and my weight is only 45 kg. I am the third of four children. And I am Muslim. I come from a remote village in Riau Province, namely Concong Luar, Concong Luar itself is a coastal village where 80% of the livelihood is fishing.
		I am now a student at a State University in the Riau Archipelago, Raja Ali Haji Maritime University. I study at the Faculty of Engineering, Electrical Engineering study program. I am also a member of a Robot community “Senggarang Robotic Club”. For hobby, I like table tennis and chess, but I'm not an expert player, my favorite food is fried noodles, my favorite drink is anything that is sweet, haha. I love watching football matches, my proud club is FC BARCELONA and my favorite football player is Lionel Messi. I also like playing video games and reading comics. For me, being able to read comics in peace is the simplest happiness and the thing I like the most is waiting for the comic to update.
		I created this blog to fulfill my final assignment for web and multimedia lectures at Widya Mandala University, Surabaya</p>
